# Code Of Conduct

TealinuxOS Release Party is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by the Python Software Foundation or not.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at any TealinuxOS Release Party event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
